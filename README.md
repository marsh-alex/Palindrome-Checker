### Overview:
This is a bare bones application that takes a user string input and determines wether or not it is a palindrome. 

## Features:
- User input field with submit button
- Message that informs you whether or not the input is a palindrome 
- An output that spells the word forwards and backwards so you can see the palindrome for yourself
- Regular expressions to find and remove white space, any non-word characters and underscores

## Tools: 
- Codepen
- VS Code
- GitHub
- Google Dev Tools

## Outcome: 
This was one of the first algortitmic problems I came up with a solution for. It was an exciting process the think about the various JS string methods I could use to achieve a viable algorithm and then how to connect this to UI so it could actually be used. 

- I learned a lot about regular expressions for custom from validation
- How to use event listeners to make applications interactive
- How to use template literals to easily display script within the DOM

## Languages:
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript
